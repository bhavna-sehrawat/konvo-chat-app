## Introduction

**Konvo** is a modern, real-time chat application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It provides a seamless and interactive user experience for one-on-one conversations, featuring live online status updates and a secure authentication system. This project showcases a robust backend API, a dynamic frontend, and real-time communication capabilities using Socket.io.

## How It Works

Konvo's architecture is composed of two main parts: a **React frontend** and a **Node.js/Express backend**.

1.  **RESTful API**: The backend serves a secure RESTful API for user authentication (signup, login, logout) and data operations (fetching users, past messages).
2.  **JWT Authentication**: Upon login, the server generates a JSON Web Token (JWT), which is stored on the client. This token is sent with subsequent requests to access protected API routes.
3.  **WebSocket Communication**: For real-time functionality, the application uses **Socket.io**.
    -   When a user logs in, the client establishes a persistent WebSocket connection to the server.
    -   The server maintains a list of connected users and broadcasts online status updates to all clients.
    -   When a message is sent, the client emits a `sendMessage` event. The server receives this message, saves it to the database, and then relays it to the appropriate recipient via their socket connection.
